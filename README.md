# air_quality

We reviewed some of the more common airborne pollutants across the USA and built a website demonstrating concentrations of the pollutants on an interactive map of the USA.  We used Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Flask, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SQLite, and DS3.

Short desciptions of the pollutants were included on the pages and included external links for the user who wants additional information.

We did not look into causes or reasons for the concentrations of the pollutants, as this was just a study of the current air quality.

Our data came from https://openaq.org/ API and mapping came from mapbox.com.
